## Data Limitations & Challenges

### PDF Access Issues
- Several state agriculture department PDFs were inaccessible or corrupted:
  - CDFA licensed operations list PDF

  - USDA National Shippers Contact List
- These would contain comprehensive license holder data

### Missing Official Directories
- Some states don't publish public searchable databases
- Many require direct agency contact for complete lists
- Industry associations have member-only directories

### Recommended Next Steps for Complete Data
1. Direct contact with state agriculture departments for current license lists
2. PACA license search for federal compliance verification
3. Industry association membership directories
4. Blue Book Services (commercial produce directory)
5. State-specific FOIA requests for license databases
