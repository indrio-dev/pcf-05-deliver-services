      "primaryRegion": "Southeast",
      "category": "Fruits and Preserves",
      "description": "The Bradford Watermelon is an oblong, dark green rind watermelon with red flesh and white seeds weighing 30 lbs fully grown. Depending upon the soil it is grown in, the rind develops longitudinal sutures. The form was first described in detail in 1860: 'The rind is a grayish-green color, closely traversed by fine dark green veins; flesh varying from light to deep red, extremely sweet and tender, sometimes separating from the rind like the Orange watermelon; seeds white and small; size varying from medium to quite large. ' Lowell Daily Citizen & News 9, 1207, April 4, 1860, 1. Created in Sumter, SC., because of the efforts of the 19th-century agronomist William D. Brinkle of Philadelphia, Bradford Watermelon seed was distributed throughout the north in the 1860s. It was one of the standard garden melons grown in the post Civil War era throughout the United States. Because of the shorter growing season of watermelons developed for northern gardens by seed brokers in the 1880s, the Bradford became basically a market melon grown in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and to a lesser extent North Carolina and Tennessee. By the twentieth century it had reduced to Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. In Florida, a Bradford/Rattlesnake cross, the Florida Favorite, supplanted it in fields. By 1925 it was grown only in South Carolina. The Bradford Watermelon when perfected in the early 1850s benefitted from the textural crispness that was the hallmark of the Mountain Sweet Watermelon, while possessing the sugariness and nuance of the Lawson Watermelon. It was a superior melon for consumption as is. But its sugariness made it particularly useful for the manufacture of watermelon molasses. The boiling down of melon meat in sorghum evaporator pans was a common process in the late 19th century. Indeed, Col. William Duncan of Charleston, SC, and Jonathan Davis in Georgia manufactured commercial brands of Watermelon sweetener. They found, like present day commercial producers of watermelon syrup for snow cones find, that the taste of watermelon was so associated with summer that their molasses had a short sales season. Nevertheless, the Bradford Watermelon was the ideal rendering melon for summer molasses. [See illustration of 2013 Bradford Watermelon Molasses making in Sumter, SC] Watermelon pickles process the edible rinds of watermelons as a condiment. The quality that most recommended a variety of watermelon for pickling with the tendency of the rind and sub-rind (exocarp) to become glassy or translucent upon long boiling at low heat. While the Citron Watermelon was bred exclusively for pickling, certain standard watermelons were considered worthwhile sources for pickles. The Bradford stood foremost among these in the American South. The recipe for pickling is as follows: One of the three oldest surviving North American watermelons for which a breeding discipline and a standard configuration developed, the Bradford Watermelon came into existence in the 1840s and 1850s in Sumter, SC bred by Nathaniel Napoleon Bradford (1809-1882). Because of the promiscuity with which melons, squashes, and cucumbers cross pollinate and hybridize, the imposition of a breeding discipline has always been difficult for watermelons. Commentators on watermelons available in American markets prior to 1820 complained about the miscellaneous coloration, shape, and taste of the watermelons being sold. Hollowing of the heart, predominance of white under-rind (exocarp), dumpiness of shape, slushiness of the flesh and insipid taste led the list of faults. Watermelon breeding began in earnest in the 1820s and the first successes were in imposing regularity of form. Two watermelons-the Mountain Sweet and the Mountain Sprout (or Carolina Long)-established the 'picnic' or oblong melon as a standard form, while the Black Spanish and the Carolina Round established the compact round melon form. Of these early melons the Mountain Sweet and the Black Spanish survive. If you taste these melons in their present forms, they seem neither particularly sweet (both have about 5-6% sugar) nor crisp in texture. Sweetness and flavor came to American watermelons from a lost legendary ancestor melon, the Lawson. The Lawson was the parent of both the Bradford Watermelon (the South Carolina melon) and the Rattlesnake Watermelon (the Georgia Watermelon), the greatest surviving antebellum watermelons.Of the Lawson Watermelon and its relation to the Bradford Watermelon. In 1883 Judge John F. Lawson of Burke Country Florida related the story of the development of his namesake melon to a group of Georgia newspaper reporters: 'My paternal ancestors were among the original settlers of Sunbury, in Liberty county, at which place my grandfather, John Franklin Lawson was a resident at the commencement of the revolutionary war, and during which he entered the colonial services. At the time of the capture of Charleston in 1783, while commanding a company near Charleston somewhere, he was captured by the British, and taken to the West Indies Islands, and imprisoned from two months. While on one of the prison ships he was tendered by the Captain (a generously bred Scotchman) a slice of watermelon, of which he saved the seed, and upon his return to Sunbury, planted them-from this seed the Lawson watermelon came. The particular variety was preserved pure owing to no other melon to be grown in the same place. My grandfather did so until my father, A. J. Lawson, in 1814 moved to Burke from Liberty, and bringing the seed with him, by careful cultivation, including the total prohibition of other seed on the plantation, brought the melon to its present great perfection. I presume the reason that it has never been cultivated as a market melon is that it was neither an early variety, nor a prolific bearer. Besides, it takes the most exact care and attention, both in the cultivation and the preparation of the seed before planting.' (Macon Telegraph June 30, 1883.) The Lawson by every account was the best tasting watermelon of the antebellum era in the United States, but it was irregular in shape, unproductive, difficult to grow, and prone to hollowing and available only to persons in Burke County, GA, or networked to Judge Lawson. One of Lawson's friends was the agricultural experimentalist John B. Jones of Burke County, who developed many market varieties of field peas. Jones conveyed Lawson seed to numbers of people, including Nathaniel Bradford and seed brokers Plumb & Leitner in Augusta Georgia. Bradford began crossing the Lawson with the Mountain Sweet to create the Bradford, a beautifully configured melon with Lawson Taste. Plumb & Leitner crossed it with the Mountain Sprout (Carolina Long) watermelon to create the famous striped Rattlesnake melon. The Bradford became the important late season market melon in the South from the 1860s through the 1910s. The Rattlesnake was the predominant shipping melon from the 1860s through the 1890s, and remained a favorite garden watermelon well into the 20th century. The onslaught of fusarium wilt in the 1890s and the creation of boxcar melons with rinds so tough that melons could be stacked nine deep without crushing (perhaps the Kolb's Gem is the first of these rhino-hided melons in the mid-1880s) led to the supplanting of these superb melons. Since the 20th century flavor has been sacrificed for transportability and disease resistance in breeding. The last commercial crop of Bradford melons was planted in 1922 outside of Augusta, GA. In the latter portion of the 20th century the various southern gardeners who kept the breed alive under its various names (Alabama Sweet, Pierson's Watermelon, Tinker, Hoke Sweet, and McGuire) abandoned it for the more disease resistant Kleckley Sweet heirloom melon. Finally only the Bradford family itself kept the stock alive-for eight generations, until Nathaniel Bradford in 2012 stepped forward to champion the restoration of this historic standard of watermelon quality. _s of 2013 the Bradford Watermelon is being grown in only two plots-a 2/3 acre field outside of Sumter, SC, and a 1/10 acre field outside of Seneca, SC. Both are under the control of the Bradford family. Nat Bradford, the 8th generation namesake of the original breeder, has announced his determination to restore this classic watermelon to the regional table. He has sought the aid of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, Slow Food, and various local markets to insure that the Bradford Watermelon would re-emerge as an emblematic creation of the region's summer bounty. These efforts came to fruition in summer 2013. Slow Food Upstate's Chapter, the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation (Glenn Roberts and David Shields particularly), McCrady's Restaurant, and GroFood Carolina, enabled three hundred melons to be harvested, fifty of which were designated seed melons. The pulp and rind of the seed melons were rendered into molasses and pickle by Jeremiah Langhorne of McCrady's Restaurant. Field melons were sold in Charleston and Greenville, becoming the produce novelty of the summer. Numbers of restaurants featured it on their menus.",

      "description": "Widely regarded as the best tasting strawberry produced in the United States during the first half of the 20th century, the Fairfax was juicy with a luscious mouth-filling sweetness. The low acid made them ideal freezing berries. But the quality that made them the favorite at the produce stand and market was their sweetness. Donald Hyde Scott in Strawberry Varieties in the United States (1979) said, that they possessed “Excellent dessert quality.” It is a highly productive cultivar as almost every flower generates a fruit. Believed to be a cross between the Royal Sovereign and Howard 17 strawberries made by George Darrow at the Glenn Dale, Maryland USDA small fruits breeding station, the Fairfax was selected for development in 1925, and over three years the qualities of the berry were fine tuned. In 1928 it was released and quickly won consumers over with its superlative taste. Grown in the upper South, New Jersey, and the Pacific Northwest, the Fairfax was a favorite until the final quarter of the 20th century. The Fairfax is a variety not suitable for monocropping. The plants are not as fully disease resistant as some of the modern cultivars are. Another drawback is a soft texture of the strawberries that makes them more prone to bruising and damage while in shipment. The organization of a national market for berries and the concentration of the business in a very few companies hastened the virtual extinction of the Fairfax after the 1980s. In 2000 a home gardener could not buy a plant from a nursery. Mike Welik, a grower from Middleton DE, thought it bizarre that the best tasting strawberry that American genetics produced, had vanished. Securing plant material from the USDA clonal germ plasm repository, he brought the plant back, supply pots of rooted Fairfax strawberries to growers. Today, however, the plants have become available in limited quantities.",

      "description": "The Harrison apple was described in 1817 by the early fruit writer William Coxe as the celebrated Newark or Orange Cider Apple. The small, round-oblong apple is yellow in color, sometimes in the Middle Atlantic states blushed a light pink. The stem is an inch or more in length. Tiny black spots on the skin surface give it a rough texture. Long out of cultivation, the American nurseryman and fruit historian Tom Burford located a single tree in 1989 in New Jersey and collected scionwood for propagation; this tree died a few years later. Coxe described the Harrison's flavor as similar to a quince, while Burford describes it as 'rich and sprightly with a dry aftertaste, suitable for dessert as well as cider.' The apple is scab- and rot-resistant, bears annual, full crops, and keeps well in storage. In the colonial period Harrison juice was blended with that of the Graniwinkle apple to produce one of the most popular alcoholic ciders. Harrison juice makes an extremely dark, rich cider with exceptional mouthfeel; as a single-variety cider it commanded the highest price in the New York market, 'frequently ten dollars and upwards per barrel when fined for bottling.' In one orchard in Essex County, New Jersey, Coxe reports that a single tree produced upwards of 100 bushels of apples. Harrison apple production is historically known from before 1817 until about 1900 in the apple production regions of the eastern United States. It originated in Essex County, New Jersey, but was grown extensively throughout the Mid-Atlantic and eastern U.S. Current production (recovery) is focused on Virginia, but trees have recently been distributed, mainly to home orchardists and small commercial cider producers throughout the U.S.",

C.,  and P. J. Berkmanns of Fruitlands in Augusta, Georgia. Both listed it among their fruit offerings in nursery catalogs before the outbreak of the Civil War, making the reputation of the apple. While recommended as a fresh eating apple, it was also used for making sauce and for baking. I could keep up to half a year after picking, if stored in a cool dark place. Like many early American apples, it tends to bear heavily every other year. For the last half of the nineteenth century it was a hugely popular variety, but its vulnerability to fire blight, its late season ripening, and the great variability of yearly harvests caused it to declin in popularity after the turn of the twentieth century. Only its excellent flavor kept southerners and orchardists in the Pacific Northwest from uprooting the trees.",

The fruit is eaten sliced, fresh and canned. This tomato variety was first introduced to the United States public by the Livingston Seed Company of Columbus, Ohio in 1905. It was first widely cultivated in Reynoldsburg, Ohio and Omaha, Nebraska. Mr. Alexander Livingston created the tomato in 1899 as cross between the Livingston Stone Tomato and the Ponderosa Tomato, seeing to create tomatoes with smooth skin, were uniform in size and had a better flavor. The shape, size, and smooth skin of the Livingston Globe provided the template for the commercial tomato of the twentieth century, when product uniformity became the hallmark of industrially farmed produced. Yet subsequent breeders abandoned the Livingston family’s commitment to superb tomato flavor and inviting texture. The flattened oblate shape that predominated among tomatoes of the 19th century was though to constrain the number of slices one could cut per tomato. Livingston wished a longer globe shaped fruit. At its launch, the Livingston Company enumerated the variety’s qualities: early ripening, marketable size, firmness of flesh, even ripeness, absence of yellow in the color, and productivity. For decades it reigned in the fields of the Midwest but monocropping for market exposed weakness in the plant: susceptibility to viral diseases, problems with splitting in rainy conditions, and rather quick spoilage after becoming ripe. The abandonment of the Livingston Globe for the modern industrially produced tomatoes with  their lack of flavor, tough texture, and gas ripening has been amply documented. The Livingston Globe has become a scarce heirloom, and its place as the most versatile slicing and canning tomato in the United States has largely been forgotten.",

      "description": "The 'cranberry of the south,' the mayhaw (Crataegus aestivalis, C. opaca, C. rufula) is an indigenous fruit native to the lower southern states of the United States, grown from North Carolina to East Texas. The fruit is about 1-2 cm in diameter, spherical and covered with a thin skin. Ripe berries can be either yellow or red, though red mayhaws have been more widely cultivated. Inside, the fruit has a white pulp with few seeds. There are three native varieties of Mayhaw tree grown today: Heavy, Big Red and Super Spur. Super Spur is praised for the flavor of its fruit, and is considered to produce excellent berries for jellies and syrups. When eaten raw, mayhaws are typically described as bitter and sour, sometimes slightly sweet, and with a high acid content; however, they are not commonly eaten raw. Jellies and jams are made only with the strained juice of the fruit. These finished products can range in hues of yellow to pink to red, are described as tasting 'wild-fruity.' To create the jelly, the mayhaw fruit is cooked in a ratio of one gallon of fruit to three gallons of water. The fruit is boiled and cooked for thirty minutes. Once the fruit has cooked, the juice can be pressed from the berry, typically through cheesecloth to prevent the seeds and skin from joining the juice. Afterwards, the juice will be heated, mixed with pectin, and sugar will be added. Once the sugar has been dissolved and the solution has boiled for one minute more, the jelly is stored in sterilized jars. The mayhaw's native habitat of swamps and marginal areas once discouraged individuals from foraging the wild plant. Mayhaw berries were foraged once they had dropped ripe from their branches and bobbed in the waters around their growing locations, and foragers would have to use boats and nets to collect the berries. Despite this, the fruit has been recorded as being used in jellies and syrups since the 17th century. It was typically served with game dishes, such as venison, wild duck and wild turkey. Around the late-1800s the fruit's popularity gave rise to the cultivation of mayhaw trees. Today, there are several mayhaw festivals celebrated throughout the growing region, including in Miller County, Georgia; Daisetta, Texas; El Dorado, Arkansas; and Starks and Marion, Louisiana. Each of these festivals coincides with the harvesting of the fruit and jelly, typically in late April to May. Today mayhaw jelly is typically served alongside ice cream or coffeecake, or biscuits or toast for breakfast. It is also used in both savory and sweet dishes, such as sauces for meats, poultry or BBQ sauce, to create pie fillings and dessert sauces or used in cocktails. Mayhaw butter, jam and wine are also traditional delicacies. These jellies, syrups and other products are sold in very limited quantities by small-scale vendors throughout the South.",

      "description": "Meech’s Prolific is a historic American variety of the common quince (Cydonia oblonga). It was discovered in Connecticut around the middle of the 19th century and  named after Reverend William W. Meech, who first popularized it as the ‘Pear-Shaped Orange Quince’ in an 1883 botanical article and in his definitive book, Quince Culture (1888). There he described it as the “most uniformly prolific of all known varieties.” The trees are vigorous, self-fertile, and have very large and showy white blossoms. According to Reverend Meech, this variety is precocious in bearing, and it is not uncommon for one-year-old trees to blossom in the nursery and occasionally bear fruit to ripeness. The fruit itself is obtusely pyriform (pearlike) in shape and bright golden yellow. Meech describes the fruit as large, up to 18 oz. (525 g) in weight, but averaging 12 to 15 oz. (350 to 437 g), or roughly 17 fruits to the rounded peck. Meech’s Prolific quince is extremely fragrant reminiscent of apples, flowers and vanilla. Traditionally quinces have been used to make aromatic and tasty preserves.  Tasted raw, the Meech’s Prolific is intensely tart, but quick-cooked it has a bright strong taste with a pleasant piney tartness, like a pineapple or mango, with caramel and pear notes. Its quick-cooked texture is like a very ripe peach, soft and sweet and nicely crisp and it is bright, clear yellow in color. This is an excellent quince variety for preserves or jelly. Today, only around 200 acres of quince trees are grown commercially in the United States, and it is considered a little-known specialty fruit. In addition to its culinary uses, the quince has historically been recognized as an herbal medicine. The fruit’s astringency makes it useful as a digestive aid and to relieve gas, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. The seeds, when soaked in boiling water, swell up and form a mucilaginous mass that has mildly laxative, astringent, and anti-inflammatory properties; this infusion has been used to treat sore gums, throats, and breasts, as an eye lotion, and to soothe minor burns.",

The group of African landraces that came to be known as crowder peas received their name from their habit of filling pods so fully that the ends of the peas are flattened; in effect, the peas are crowded together. Pods of the Mississippi Silver Hull Pea average six inches in length and are silver colored, occasionally streaked with rose. The globular seeds are brown with a black rimmed thin white eye. The plants are heat and drought resistant and have a climbing bush configuration. They can grow up to 120 cm tall. Grown on good soil, the Silver Hull Peas have a rich earthy umami. They are excellent for pea gravy, when boiled or baked. They manifest good culinary quality when prepared fresh from shelling or dried down and reconstituted by soaking in water. The immature peas are sometimes roasted like peanuts. Though the Silver Hull has good resistance to nematodes and fusarium infestation, it is less hardy that certain of the agronomic varieties of recent creation. Though recognized as a local standard in Mississippi, the acreage being planted has declined yearly as farmers choose more productive and widely saleable varieties such as White Acre, Knuckle, and Pink Eye Purple Hull.",

      "description": "In the early 1850s French chemists determined that Sorghum bicolor, a family of grasses related to sugar cane and native to China and Africa, contained nearly as much saccharine matter as sugar cane. Until this finding Western agronomists planted the plant as broom corn, using it as fodder and boiling the seed heads of “Guinea Corn.” In 1855 Lawrence Ray shipped 15 varieties of Sorghum from Natal South Africa to ex-Gov. James Hammond of South Carolina for experimental planting. Because sugar cane was cold sensitive and would grow in Climate Zone 8 or lower without repeated crop failures, planters sought cold tolerant substitutes. Crushing the sorghum stalks, extracting and boiling down the juice produced a sweet dark syrup that proved widely agreeable. Certain starches in sorghum prevented the refinement of this syrup into granulated saccharine, so the syrup remained the mode in which sorghum was consumed. When the Civil War disrupted the supply of Louisiana sugar to the North, and then after the battle of Vicksburg, to the South, farmers universally began planting sorghum. In the post Civil War era sorghum syrup was a sweetner produced on an industrial scale. In 1888 the total US sorghum syrup production was 20,000,000 gallons. Sorghum syrup has a unique taste—less malty than molasses, more pungent than cane syrup with an interesting edge to the sweetness. In the South it installed itself as a pantry favorite. But several circumstances eroded the popularity of sorghum. Sugar Beets were discovered to be so cold tolerant that they could be grown in Canada, so the entire continental United States could produce sweetener; and sugar beets would refine to crystal, something that sorghum could not do.  In the 1920s it was discovered that Sorghum Syrup blocked the uptake of Niacin in human beings, and amplified the vitamin deficiancy problems of country people who consumed niacin poor corn as a dietary staple. Sorghum’s connection with Palagra caused its cultural eclipse. Nevertheless, sweet things have a way of lingering and resisting cultural efforts to medicalize them out of existence. Sorghum Syrup survived as a quaint country treat from yesteryear until the heirloom and regional foods revival of the past two decades bringing new artisanal producers into the southern regional market. Nowadays every southern state has a handful of small scale producers, and companies such as Muddy Pond Sorghum from Tennessee have regional distribution.",

Washington died shortly after receiving the sheep and they were consigned to Judge Richard Peters of Pennsylvania who oversaw the propagation and dissemination of the breed in the mid-Atlantic states. In short order it took on distinct new features and became the first American sheep breed. The Tunis ranked second to the Merino among the more agricultural of the founding fathers: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Judge Richard Peters, and George Washington. The Tunis was the mainstay of sheep production in the upper South until the Civil War, when nearly all of the Southern stock was destroyed. The remaining stock was harbored in the north after the war, and the Great Lakes region and New England became the stronghold of the breed. Southern interest in the breed has burgeoned since 2000. The interest derives from the animal’s virtues. The Tunis sheep is striking and attractive in appearance, with cream or ivory colored wool that is set nicely contrasted by a cinnamon-red face and legs. Their pendulous ears and expressive eyes give a quizzical aspect to their demeanor, which is correctly interpreted as calm and docile.
