## Gap Analysis Summary

### CRITICAL GAPS FILLED ✅

1. ✅ Iceberg Lettuce (70% of lettuce market)
2. ✅ Jalapeño (40% of hot peppers)
3. ✅ Meeker Raspberry (40% of PNW)
4. ✅ California Wonder Bell Pepper (30%)

- More commercial tomato hybrids (processing, greenhouse)
- More iceberg lettuce strains
- More commercial plums (CA)

**Lower priority:**
- Livestock is intentionally heritage-heavy (mission-aligned)
- Vegetables have good commercial + heritage mix
- Citrus has major varieties, could add variants

## Validation Readiness Assessment

### READY FOR SHARE MODEL VALIDATION ✅

**Products with ≥80% commercial coverage (6):**
1. Strawberries (100%) - UC Davis + UF/IFAS extensive trials
2. Apples (86%) - USApple, WSU, Cornell, UMN extensive
3. Peppers (100%) - State extension data
4. Blueberries (100%) - USDA, MSU, UF/IFAS trials
5. Raspberries (100%) - WSU, Cornell, Rutgers data
6. [One more at 80%+]

**These products:**
- Represent major consumer purchases
- Have extensive university research and published Brix/quality data
- Can validate GDD models, Brix predictions, SHARE framework
- Cover major producing states (CA, FL, WA, MI, etc.)

### GOOD ENOUGH FOR VALIDATION (60-79% coverage - 3 products)

**Plums (67%)**, **Potatoes (61%)**, **Peaches (previous analysis ~65%)**
- Have major commercial varieties
- Enough to validate models
- Could add depth later

### NEEDS MORE WORK (<60% but less critical for initial validation)

**Oranges (50%)** - Have juice + fresh leaders, could add FL midseason depth
**Tomatoes (43%)** - Have hybrids + heirlooms, heritage-weighted by design
**Lettuce (40%)** - Have Iceberg (70% of market), romaine types, could add depth

---

## Recommendation

### FOR MODEL VALIDATION (Current Goal): ✅ READY

**We have sufficient commercial coverage to:**
1. Validate SHARE framework with published university data
2. Prove GDD models work (cherries, strawberries, apples, peaches, blueberries)
3. Demonstrate Brix prediction accuracy
4. Test quality tier classification

**6-9 products have 60%+ commercial coverage** = enough to validate system

### FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER APP: Continue Expansion

After model validation, continue adding:
1. More FL orange midseason varieties (complete FL citrus)
2. More commercial tomato hybrids (greenhouse, processing)
3. Additional commercial lettuce strains
4. Regional specialty depth

---

## Next Phase: Measurement Data Collection

**Now that commercial cultivars are loaded, next priority:**

1. **Find published measurement data** for commercial varieties:
   - UC Davis fruit variety trials (Brix, acid, quality scores)
   - UF/IFAS citrus variety data
   - WSU stone fruit trials
   - University extension publications

2. **Link measurements to cultivars** in database

3. **Validate SHARE predictions** against research data

4. **Then expand** to heritage varieties (collect our own data via Edacious, farmers)

**STATUS: Ready to begin measurement data collection phase** ✅
