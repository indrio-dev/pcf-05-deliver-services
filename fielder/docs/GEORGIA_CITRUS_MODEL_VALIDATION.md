# Georgia Citrus Data - Framework Validation

**Source:** UGA Extension Circular 1275 (December 2021)
**Location:** Sweet Valley Citrus, Valdosta, GA (southern Georgia)
**Data:** 40 variety/rootstock combinations tested December 15, 2021
**Purpose:** Validate H (rootstock, age) and R (timing) effects on E (Brix)

---

## Key Validation Tests from This Data

### Test 1: Rootstock Effects (H Pillar)

**Sugar Belle on 6 Different Rootstocks (Same variety, same age 3-6 years):**

| Rootstock | Age | Brix | Acid | Ratio |
|-----------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Rubidoux | 3yr | 13.7°Bx | 1.65 | 8.3 |
| US-897 | 3yr | 13.3°Bx | 1.78 | 7.5 |
| US-942 | 3yr | 13.1°Bx | 1.62 | 8.1 |
| US-852 | 3yr | 12.7°Bx | 1.48 | 8.6 |
| Goutou | 4yr | 12.0°Bx | 1.11 | 10.8 |
| X-639 | 6yr | 12.1°Bx | 1.53 | 7.9 |

**Brix range:** 12.0 - 13.7°Bx (1.7°Bx difference from rootstock!)

**Validates:** Rootstock DOES affect Brix
**Best:** Rubidoux 13.7°Bx
**Worst:** Goutou/X-639 12.0-12.1°Bx

**Framework prediction:** Rootstock modifiers +/- 0.5 to 0.8°Bx
**Actual variation:** 1.7°Bx (slightly larger than predicted)

---

### Test 2: Age Effects (H×R Pillar)

**Glen Navel on Different Rootstocks at Different Ages:**

| Rootstock | Age | Brix |
|-----------|-----|------|
| Sour Orange | 7yr | 9.4°Bx |
| US-852 | 4yr | 10.2°Bx |

**Younger tree (4yr) has HIGHER Brix than older (7yr)?**

**Possible explanations:**
1. Rootstock effect: US-852 > Sour Orange (likely!)
2. 7-year tree approaching prime but Sour Orange is lower-quality rootstock
3. Tree stress on Sour Orange (CTV susceptible)

---

**Shiranui Mandarin at Different Ages:**

| Rootstock | Age | Brix |
|-----------|-----|------|
| US-897 | 5yr | 13.5°Bx (HIGHEST!)
| Swingle | 6yr | 11.8°Bx
| US-852 | 3yr | 11.7°Bx
| US-942 | 2yr | 11.0°Bx (youngest)

**Age 5 years highest** (13.5°Bx)
**Age 2 years lowest** (11.0°Bx)

**2.5°Bx difference from age/rootstock combined**

**Validates:** Age matters, but confounded with rootstock

---

### Test 3: December Timing (R Pillar)

**All measured December 15, 2021:**
```
This is EARLY season for Georgia citrus
Most varieties immature or just reaching maturity
Low Brix values across the board

Examples:
- Sweet Bessie Orange: 6.7°Bx (very low!)
- Early Gold Orange: 8.1°Bx (low)
- Ambersweet: 8.1°Bx (low)

December is early harvest window for most varieties
```

**Best performers in December:**
```
Fairchild Mandarin: 16.1°Bx (12 years old - prime age!)
US Superna: 14.4°Bx (2 years old - exceptional for young tree!)
Sugar Belle: 13.7°Bx (3 years - high Brix for young trees)
```

**Framework validation:**
- December is early for sweet oranges (most 8-10°Bx)
- Mandarins mature earlier (Sugar Belle 12-14°Bx by mid-Dec)
- Early varieties (Owari Satsuma) at 11.4°Bx by December

**Timing affects Brix significantly** (early harvest = lower Brix)

---

## Exceptional Performers

### Fairchild Mandarin: 16.1°Bx!

```
Age: 12 years (prime!)
Rootstock: Flying Dragon
Brix: 16.1°Bx
Acid: 0.93%
Ratio: 17.3

This is ARTISAN tier!
Genetic ceiling + prime age + rootstock = exceptional
```

**Framework would predict:**
```
Fairchild genetic baseline: ~13°Bx (mandarin)
+ Prime age (12yr): +0°Bx (at ceiling)
+ Flying Dragon rootstock: +0.5°Bx (dwarf, quality)
+ December timing: Early (might be -0.5°Bx penalty)

Predicted: 13.0°Bx
Actual: 16.1°Bx
Error: 3.1°Bx UNDER (we under-predicted!)
```

**This shows:** Fairchild genetic ceiling is HIGHER than generic mandarin
- Our baseline too low for this variety
- Need variety-specific genetic ceilings (H pillar refinement)

---

### US Superna (88-2): 14.4°Bx at Only 2 Years Old!

```
Age: 2 years (VERY young!)
Rootstock: US-852
Brix: 14.4°Bx
Acid: 0.82%

This is exceptional for a 2-year-old tree!
```

**Framework expectation:**
```
Age 2: Should be -0.8°Bx penalty (young, developing)
Expected: 10-11°Bx for young tree

Actual: 14.4°Bx (at mature tree levels!)
```

**This shows:** US Superna is exceptional early-bearing variety
- Precocious (produces quality fruit young)
- High genetic ceiling
- Should be flagged as premium cultivar

---

## Poor Performers (Early Harvest Issues)

### Sweet Bessie Orange: 6.7°Bx

```
Age: 4 years
Rootstock: US-852
Brix: 6.7°Bx (VERY LOW!)
Acid: 0.66%
Ratio: 10.2

This is below commodity tier
```

**Analysis:**
- December is TOO EARLY for this variety
- Needs to mature longer (January-February)
- Or this variety has inherently low Brix ceiling

---

## Rootstock Comparison (Controlled Test!)

**Sugar Belle on Different Rootstocks (All 3 years old):**

```
Rubidoux: 13.7°Bx (BEST)
US-897: 13.3°Bx
US-942: 13.1°Bx
US-852: 12.7°Bx (WORST)

Difference: 1.0°Bx from rootstock choice
All same age, same variety, same date
Pure rootstock effect!
```

**Framework implication:**
- Rubidoux produces highest Brix for Sugar Belle
- US-852 produces lowest
- Need to adjust our rootstock modifiers based on this data

---

## Age Effect Observations

**Comparing different ages (rough pattern):**

```
Age 1-2 years: 9.6-14.4°Bx (wide range, variety-dependent)
Age 3-4 years: 8.7-13.7°Bx (developing)
Age 5-7 years: 9.4-13.5°Bx (approaching prime)
Age 11-13 years: 8.1-16.1°Bx (prime, wide variety range)
```

**Age 12 years (prime) examples:**
```
Fairchild: 16.1°Bx (exceptional genetic ceiling)
Ambersweet: 8.1°Bx (low genetic ceiling or early harvest)
Marr's: 10.7°Bx (moderate)

At prime age, genetic ceiling (H) dominates
```

## Framework Validation Summary

### What This Data Validates:

✅ **Rootstock matters:** 1.0-1.7°Bx difference (Sugar Belle, Shiranui tests)
✅ **Age matters:** Young trees generally lower, but variety-dependent
✅ **December timing:** Early for most varieties (many 8-10°Bx, immature)
✅ **Genetic variation:** 6.7-16.1°Bx range (variety is dominant factor!)

### What Needs Calibration:

⚠️ **Variety-specific genetic ceilings:**
- Fairchild: 16°Bx ceiling (higher than generic 13°Bx)
- US Superna: 14°Bx ceiling (precocious, high quality)
- Sweet Bessie: 7-8°Bx ceiling? (very low)

⚠️ **Rootstock modifiers need refinement:**
- Rubidoux: Better than predicted for Sugar Belle
- US-852: Worse than predicted
- Need variety×rootstock interaction data

⚠️ **Age modifiers:**
- US Superna at 2 years: 14.4°Bx (no penalty!)
- Shows: Precocious varieties exist
- Age effect is variety-dependent
